# We will include a Property Chain which allows the reasoner to infer that
# the concept "Morphine sulphate product" has an active ingredient of "Morphine substance"
# causing it to be classified under "Morphine product"
#

# The following OWL Axiom states that a new "Has active ingredient" attribute can be inferred
# by taking the "Is modification of" attribute value from any existing "Has active ingredient" value
#
# Here is a more human readable version:
# SubObjectPropertyOf(
#     ObjectPropertyChain(
#         :127489000 - Has active ingredient attribute
#         :738774007 - Is modification of attribute
#     )
#     :127489000 - Has active ingredient attribute
# )
# This behaviour will NOT be inherited by any ancestors of this attribute
